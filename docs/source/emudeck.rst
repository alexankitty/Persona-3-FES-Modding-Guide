EmuDeck
=======

| The folks handling the EmuDeck project already have a guide
  specifically for Persona 3 FES on their `GitHub
  wiki <https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/PCSX2-QT#how-to-mod-persona-3-fes>`__.
  I would recommend reading through it for the steps specific to
  EmuDeck.Â  At this time they do recommend an outdated version of the
  party control mod. The updated one is
  `here <https://gamebanana.com/mods/426860>`__. Any steps regarding CEP
  in their guide can be replaced with the contents of this guide.
| Your mod folder will be copied to ``Emulation/roms/ps2``. You can
  rename the mod folder to anything you want, like **P3FES**.
| The section labeled "**On the SteamDeck**" can be skipped as it covers
  extracting your ELF which we did earlier.
| Instances of ``SLUS_216.21.ELF`` can be replaced by whatever you named
  your ELF file, like **Persona 3 FES.ELF**
| Make sure to copy your ISO to ``Emulation/roms`` as well.
| Your cheats and textures folders copied into
  ``/home/deck/.config/PCSX2/``
| Follow `these
  instructions <https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/PCSX2-QT#how-to-install-custom-textures>`__
  to enable texture replacement.
| Make sure specifically for FES you disable usage of widescreen patches
  (they're outdated), and use the one provided in this guide. Individual
  game settings can be changed as detailed
  `here <https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/PCSX2-QT#how-to-set-game-settings-on-a-per-game-basis>`__.
| Lastly, make sure you set your render resolution to 2x or higher in
  the emulator.
