Using Aemulus with Other Persona Games
======================================

| For some of the other Persona games, Aemulus has a couple of
  dependencies that are required. (Persona 4 and Persona 5) Since it's
  out of the scope of this guide, I do not want to include them to make
  things more confusing. If you want to use your existing Aemulus
  install with those games, then you'll need to install these two files.
| `.NET Core 3.1 Desktop Runtime
  x64 <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.10-windows-x64-installer>`__
| `Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)
   <https://download.microsoft.com/download/5/B/C/5BC5DBB3-652D-4DCE-B14A-475AB85EEF6E/vcredist_x86.exe>`__\ Installation
  is pretty simple, clicking the links will download the packages, then
  click the downloaded files to run the application and follow the
  instructions.
| If you're on Windows 7, Aemulus is also dependent on `.Net Framework
  4.8 <https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/2d6bb6b2-226a-4baa-bdec-798822606ff1/8494001c276a4b96804cde7829c04d7f/ndp48-x86-x64-allos-enu.exe>`__.
  If you want to be able to use the application, you will need to
  download it and install it as well. Procedure is almost identical to
  the first two as well.
